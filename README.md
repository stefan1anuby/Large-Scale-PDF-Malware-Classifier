# Scalable Malware Scanner for Documents

## Overview

This project is designed to address the need for real-time document scanning of various apps and services in the digital space. Developed using Golang and Python in a microservices architecture, it aims to provide a fast and scalable solution for scanning possible malicious documents. The core of the scanner is an AI model, specifically a custom-trained neural network. By integrating this service into cloud environments, it ensures adaptability, efficiency and scalability, catering to the needs of various apps and services.

## Usage

This command sends a POST request to the malware scanner service, uploading the document you specify.
```
curl -X POST -F "file=/path/to/your/test.pdf" -H "Authorization: your_token_here" http://localhost:8080/upload
```
where `your_token_here` is the token got by interacting with the user-microservice (`/login` and `/register` endpoints from `http://localhost:8081`)

## Local installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/stefan1anuby/Scalable-Document-Malware-Scanner.git
```
### 2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Scalable-Document-Malware-Scanner
```

### 3. Modify the docker-compose file to include your cloud environment and neural network configurations.

### 4. Build and run the microservices using Docker:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
